# Workflow CA - Ã˜yvind Meldahl

In this CA we are learning how to set up tests and tailor our working environment. The project is forked from the Noroff Social Media App project.

## Get started

Clone or fork the project and use the editor of your choice.

Initialize git in the project folder:

```
git init
```

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

Build SASS and Bootstrap

```
npm run build
```

The site is setup to be viewed in Vite, to do so run:

```
npm run dev
```

## Testing

Implemented unit-tests:

- login.test.js
    - Tests successful login.
    - Tests unsuccessful login.
- logout.test.js
    - Test localstorage removing token when loggin out.
- create.test.js
    - Testing successful post creation.

Implemented cypress-tests:

- create.testing.cy.js
    - Testing creating new post the correct way.
    - Testing without title.

    - Testing using logout-button to log out.
- login.testing.cy.js
    - Testing login with correct information.
    - Testing bad email.

Both unit testing and E2E testing can be run in the terminal with one command:

```

You may also choose to run only jest:

```
npm run test-unit
